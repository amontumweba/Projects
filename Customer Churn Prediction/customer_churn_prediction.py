### Building Predictive Model

Because I need classification model, I will try using different models to choose one with highest performance. And also putting into consideration that my labels are not balanced, trying out different models is better. Below are the models I will use;
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest
3. K-Nearest Neighbor
4. Decision Tree
5. AdaBoost
6. Gradient Boosting

### Conclusion

To evaluate the performance of my models, I put into consideration different metrics which include theses ones below;
* **Recall**: When the actual value is positive, how often is the prediction correct?
* **Precision** : When a positive value is predicted, how often is the prediction correct?
* **Accuracy** : The ratio of correctly predicted observation to the total observations
* The main reason for this is mainly because, my dataset has unbalanced labels **(True (1) and False (0))**.
* Therefore, putting into consideration those three metrics mentioned above, it is observed that, **Gradient Boosting model** performs better than others followed by **Random Forest** and then **AdaBoost model**.
* **Decision tree** and **Logistic models** didn't perform well

* In addition, from the analysis made, it was observed that; 
* Germany has the highest proportion of churned customers, followed by France and then Spain
* France has the highest proportion of non churning customers, followed by Spain and then Germany
* Also, it is observed that females churn more than males
* Astonishingly, customers with credit cards have the highest churning rate
* Lastly, inactive customers churn more compared to active customers

* More to that;
* Looking at the credit score, non churned and churned customers have a small/no difference
* Looking at the age, old customers have a high level of churning rate compared to the young customers
* Looking at the tenure, customers who have spent more time with the bank are more likely to churn compared to those who have spent an average time with it.
* Looking at the balance, customers with higher balance are likely to leave which is not good for the bank
* Looking at number of products, number of products don't have much impact on the rate of churn
* And also, estimated salary has no any impact on the churn rate.

* Updating the Gradient Boosting, Random Forest and AdaBoost models with more and balanced data would make them perform better
